# Hello, Node.js! - A Beginner's Guide to Node.js

Welcome to the "Hello, Node.js!" project! In this guide, we will introduce you to the basics of Node.js by building a simple web server. This project is perfect for beginners and will help you understand how Node.js works, as well as the power of JavaScript on the server side.

## Project Overview

In this project, you'll learn how to:
- Understand what Node.js is and its key features.
- Set up Node.js on your system.
- Write and run your first Node.js script.
- Build a simple web server using the built-in HTTP module.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

You can check if you have Node.js installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```

If you don't have Node.js installed, please follow the installation instructions on the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installing Dependencies

If your project includes any dependencies, you can install them using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

For this project, no additional dependencies are required unless you decide to extend it later.

## Building the Web Server

1. Open the `server.js` file. You'll see the basic server code that uses the built-in `http` module to create a simple web server.
   
2. Run the server:

```bash
node server.js
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000/`.

3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/` to see the "Hello, Node.js!" message.

## Next Steps

Once you've completed the basic project, consider extending the server:
- Add HTML responses for a more dynamic page.
- Implement routes to handle different endpoints.
- Explore frameworks like [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for more advanced features.

Stay tuned for future videos on these topics!
